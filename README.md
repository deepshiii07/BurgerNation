# 🍔 Welcome to BurgerNation

Hi! I’m Deepshikha, and this is my lil web project built out of pure hunger and frontend passion 🫶  
**BurgerNation** is a Bootstrap-powered burger ordering website — minimal, responsive, and *dripping* with flavor.

## 💡 What is BurgerNation?

A static website that looks like a real burger chain’s landing page.  
Built to practice **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap 5**, while making it look ✨ actually cute ✨.

Think of it as:  
🍔 Burger King vibes,  
👩‍💻 Coded from scratch,  
🎀 Styled like it belongs on your phone screen right now.
